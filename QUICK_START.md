2. **Create Wallet**: Follow Phantom's setup guide to create a new wallet
3. **Save Recovery Phrase**: Store your 12-word phrase safely (you'll need this!)

### Switch to DevNet

üö® **Important**: We're using Solana's test network (DevNet), not real money!

1. **Open Phantom**: Click the Phantom extension
2. **Settings**: Click gear icon ‚Üí "Developer Settings"
3. **Change Network**: Select **"Devnet"** from dropdown

2. **Visit Faucet**: Go to [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com/)
3. **Request SOL**: Paste address, select "Devnet", request 1-2 SOL

**Option B**: Direct Airdrop (if you have Solana CLI)
```bash

## Step 3: Get PROS Tokens ü™ô

PROS tokens are used for voting and proposal submission.

### Claim Your Airdrop

1. **Navigate**: Go to **"Get Free PROS"** page (should be in navigation)
2. **Claim Tokens**: Click **"Claim 1,000 PROS Tokens"**
3. **Approve Transaction**: Phantom will popup ‚Üí Click **"Approve"**
4. **Wait**: Transaction takes 5-15 seconds to confirm

- **Check**: You should see "1,000 PROS" in your balance indicator
- **Refresh**: If not showing, refresh the page

‚úÖ **You now have 1,000 PROS tokens for participating!**

---

## Step 4: Browse & Vote on Proposals üó≥Ô∏è

### Explore Active Proposals

1. **Homepage**: Go to main page to see proposal list
2. **Filter**: Look for proposals with **"Active"** status
3. **Read**: Click on any proposal to view details

### Cast Your First Vote

1. **Select Proposal**: Choose an active proposal that interests you
2. **Set Support Level**: 
   - Drag slider from **-100% (oppose)** to **+100% (support)**
   - Try different values to see how it affects your position
3. **Set Collateral**: 
   - Minimum **20 PROS** required
   - Higher amounts = larger reward if you're on winning side
4. **Add Comment** (optional): Share your reasoning
5. **Submit Vote**: Click **"Vote"** button
6. **Approve Transaction**: Confirm in Phantom wallet

### Understanding Voting

- **Support Scale**: -100% = strongly oppose, +100% = strongly support

- **Winning**: If your side wins (majority), you get your tokens back + share of losers' tokens
- **Losing**: If your side loses, you forfeit your staked tokens

‚úÖ **You've cast your first democratic vote on the blockchain!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient SOL for transaction"**
- **Solution**: Get more DevNet SOL from [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com/)
- **Need**: ~0.01 SOL per transaction for fees

**"PROS balance not showing"**
- **Solution**: Refresh page, check you're on DevNet, visit airdrop page again
- **Check**: Phantom wallet should show Devnet in corner

**"Transaction failed"**
- **Solution**: Ensure sufficient PROS balance, try increasing priority fee in Phantom
- **Retry**: Most failures are temporary network issues

**"Proposal voting not available"**
- **Reason**: Voting starts day after submission at UTC 0:00
- **Wait**: Check back tomorrow for voting to begin

**"Can't vote on my own proposal"**
- **Reason**: System prevents self-voting to avoid manipulation
- **Solution**: Ask friends to test vote on your proposal

### Getting Help

**Check These First**:
1. **Phantom Settings**: Confirm you're on "Devnet"
2. **PROS Balance**: Should show in navigation bar
3. **SOL Balance**: Need small amount for transaction fees
4. **Browser Refresh**: Often resolves display issues

**Still Stuck?**
- **Solana Explorer**: Search your wallet address at [explorer.solana.com](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)
- **Transaction Status**: Check if your transactions actually went through
